# ALX Airbnb Database Optimization Project

![Database Optimization](https://img.shields.io/badge/Database-Optimization-blue)
![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-13+-blue)

This repository contains advanced SQL scripts and performance optimization techniques for an Airbnb-like database system, developed as part of the ALX program.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on improving database performance through:
- Complex query writing with various join types
- Subquery optimization (correlated and non-correlated)
- Aggregation and window functions
- Index optimization
- Query refactoring
- Table partitioning
- Continuous performance monitoring
